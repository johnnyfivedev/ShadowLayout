Plan:

//* Create preview layout with all kinds of Views and ViewGroups (rounds, squares, rounded buttons)

//* Throw RuntimeException if layout has more than one child

//* Create logic for elevation disabling

//* Create method for shadow visibility

//* Create method for changing shadow color

* Create default shadow which equals view color + alpha (pick default alpha by eye)
    - add minimum possible alpha?

* Create public API for users to switch between elevation and shadow

* Make more small methods if possible







In future:

* Handle several views in layout
