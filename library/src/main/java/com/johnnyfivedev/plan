Plan:

//* Create preview layout with all kinds of Views and ViewGroups (rounds, squares, rounded buttons)

//* Throw RuntimeException if layout has more than one child

//* Create logic for elevation disabling

* Create method for hiding shadow

* Create method for changing shadow color

* Create default shadow which equals view color + alfa (pick default alpha by eye)

* Create public API for users to switch between elevation and shadow

* Make more small methods if possible







In future:

* Handle several views in layout
