Plan:

//* Create preview layout with all kinds of Views and ViewGroups (rounds, squares, rounded buttons)

* Create method for hiding shadow

* Create method for changing shadow color

* Create default shadow which equals view color + alfa (pick default alpha by eye)

//* Create logic for elevation disabling

* Create public API for users to switch between  elevation and shadow

* Make more small methods if possible

* Throw RuntimeException if layout has more than one child

* Handle several views in layout
